A liana is any of various long-stemmed, woody vines that are rooted in the soil at ground level and use trees, as well as other means of vertical support, to climb up to the canopy to get access to well-lit areas of the forest.[1] Lianas are especially characteristic of tropical moist deciduous forests and rainforests, including temperate rainforests. `(wikipedia)<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liana>`_.
